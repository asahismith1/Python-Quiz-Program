# Python-Quiz-Program
This is a quiz program made for first year University at Edith Cowan University. Score: 26/30

This consists of two files: 
'admin.py' - a CLI program that allows the user to manage a list of quiz questions which are stored in a text file. 
'quiz.py' - a GUI program that uses the data in the text file to implement a quiz game for the user to play.

Start by running admin.py, where the system will ask you to enter questions. A minimum of five questions are required for the Quiz.py to run.
After entering each question, you will enter a valid answer(s), entering 'q' when done.
Then you will be prompted to enter a question difficulty, ranging 1 to 3.

Each question, answer(s) and difficulty will be saved and appended to the 'data.txt' file, which the quiz.py program uses to randomly choose questions to quiz the user.
